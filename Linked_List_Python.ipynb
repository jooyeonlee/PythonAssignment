    "\n",
    "A linked list is created by using the node class. We create a Node object and create another class to use this node object. We pass the appropriate values thorugh the node object to point the to the next data elements.\n",

    "There are some advantages and disadvantages with this data structure. **Advantages** Linked Lists can save memory because they can be flexibile with memory management which saves memory. **Disadvantages** Finding or adding to the list requires traversing the entire list."
